# Media-Convert

Media-Convert was built out of a need to take 18 TB of data and normalize it into one single format automatically. The goal is to have this script run on a schedule.

The script will search all files and either re-encode files that do not meet target criteria or switch container for those applicaple files.

### Required Software
1. ffmpeg
2. MediaInfo (included)
